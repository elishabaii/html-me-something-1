	<main>	If you're curious why I chose launchcode to help pursue a career in tech, well thats a good question. I have a couple 
              family members who work in tech who highly recommened launchcode and had nothing but great things to say. I am actually really 
	      happy I am here. The people have been great and the TAs are super smart amazing people who know what they are talking about and 
	      always willing to help you with any problems you have. I admit there are a lot of sections I have struggled to wrap my mind around
	      (Coding isnt easy) but all the people in the course and the people around me are going to be what gets me through this all.
	      And I know at the end of the day all of this will be worth it

	<article>	These are the people in my life that keep me going. It hasnt always been pretty but I know I am the master of my fate.
	         I will be computer programmer. Sooner than Later! When I do become a coder my ultimate goal in my career is to fix the
	         Madden series. For those who dont know I am a huge football fan, and now for the longest time the games have just been 
                 printed copies of each other and the game never gets any better. If anything it gets worse. One day I will be the one 
                 to fix the series and actually produce a good football game!</article>
